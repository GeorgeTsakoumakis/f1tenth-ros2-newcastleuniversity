# Autonomy elements & upper level chassis

Watch the following [tutorial](https://youtu.be/L-V-0zzkl10) on how to complete the car with all its vital components, including the ECU and motors. Note that at this stage you will need your 3D-printed antenna mount and laser-cut platform.

> [!NOTE]
> As noted before, you might be able to use a Jetson Orin ECU instead of the Xavier NX. This is still experimental and not yet tested as of this date.

> [!TIP]
> Congratulations! You should have built the car by now! If you have any questions you can contact any of the authors or maintainers or visit the FAQ section and see if there are any answers there.
