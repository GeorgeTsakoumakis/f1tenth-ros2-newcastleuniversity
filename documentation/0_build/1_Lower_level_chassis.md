# 1. Lower Level Chassis

Watch the following [tutorial](https://youtu.be/IoWHUGFfrRE) on how to disassemble the stock components of the car and replace them with the components of the lower level.

> [!WARNING]
> Do NOT force any parts as there is no need to do that. The only instances where you might need to use force are when [prying the Receiver](https://f1tenth.readthedocs.io/en/foxy_test/getting_started/build_car/lower_level_chassis.html) outside the Receiver box, or potentially when removing the driveshaft glass to adjust the nut if the car is struggling to move. 

> [!NOTE]
> The latter should only be done at the stage where you can at least manually drive the car, so keep it in mind. If you notice the car budging and struggling to accelerate, you will need to loosen the nut on the driveshaft.
