# Introduction

Introduction to configuring the software stack on the car.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have migrated from Jetson SDK 4.x to 5.x (or 5.x or 6.x if you are using Jetson Orin, although you will have hopefully started with that), then you only need to follow the instructions from [Step 2](https://f1tenth.readthedocs.io/en/foxy_test/getting_started/software_setup/optional_software_nx.html#run-jetson-nx-from-ssd) of *Configuring Jetson and Peripherals*

> [!NOTE]
> It is HIGHLY ENCOURAGED - and I cannot stress this enough - to FIRST read the notes on this page before following the documentation on the F1TENTH site, as the docs are currently extremely outdated and incompatible in many cases. We had to learn how to work around these issues in the first place - learn from our problems and make your lives easier.
